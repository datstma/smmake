smmake is a powerful, cross-platform alternative to the traditional Unix `make` utility. It brings the familiar functionality of `make` to Windows and other operating systems without requiring the installation of odd tools such as Win32 GNU tools.

The primary target audience in Windows x86_64/arm64 developers since there's no native make support built in. But it works on Linux and Mac just as well as a bonus should you prefer smmake over GNU make (for some unkonwn reason :) )

### - It's currently a Golang project that you can build on your own, but I will be creating installable (MSI) packages for Windows.
